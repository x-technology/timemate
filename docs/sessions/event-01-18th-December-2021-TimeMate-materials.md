# TimeMate

## Goals

- introduce TimeMate project
- take a look into GRPC
- learn basic setup for golang repo
- design architecture of system: interfaces, plugins.
- pick a module system: native golang plugins or (g)RPC plugins
- quick look into brew package publication process

## Idea

This is a demo project to automate daily rutines of consultancy agent (developer).

- track time over different platform, which you're comfortable with.
- synchronize tracked time entries with customer's software, e.g. Jira, YouTrack.
- create regular (monthly, weekly) time reports in PDF.
- create regular invoices (monthly, weekly) in PDF.
- send reports/invoices over various of channels, e.g. slack, email.
- reconcline invoices with bussiness account to mark that money is received.
- tax reporting

## GRPC

In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services. As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. On the server side, the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls. On the client side, the client has a stub (referred to as just a client in some languages) that provides the same methods as the server.

# Next Steps

- Build first gRPC server/client
- Let's implement couple of services on each side to see the whole picture
- Prepare timemate app for publication to [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
