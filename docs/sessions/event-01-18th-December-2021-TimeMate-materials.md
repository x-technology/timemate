# TimeMate

## Goals

- introduce TimeMate project
- take a look into GRPC
- quick look into brew package publication process
- design architecture of system: interfaces, plugins.
- pick a module system: native golang plugins or (g)RPC plugins

## Problem?

I'm a software engineer and a tech consultant in various companies. My daily job is to design, discuss and build web projects and micro-service architectures.
However, there is one thing I don't really like - once a month I need to sit for the whole day and start preparing reports, invoices, bills, sending it over. Also, every day I need to report "timings" in a dedicated customer's software, e.g. Jira.
To help with that task I have multiple paid tools and still spend 1 whole day a month with it:
- Jira, Toggle, Invoicing software, Business account software, Slack, Email.

## Idea

This is a demo project to automate daily routines of consultancy agent (developer).

- track time over different platform, which you're comfortable with.
- synchronize tracked time entries with a customer's software, e.g. Jira, YouTrack.
- create regular (monthly, weekly) time reports in a PDF.
- create regular invoices (monthly, weekly) in a PDF.
- send reports/invoices over various of channels, e.g. slack, email.
- reconcline invoices with a business account to mark that money is received and invoice is paid.
- tax reporting - once a year we need to sign and send special report to the tax services.

## MVP
As a first thing, I've crafted a [cli application](https://github.com/timemate/toggl-sync), which can be executed on a developer's computer and in the background do a very simple thing:
- fetch data from Toggle
- synchronize it with Jira.

### What's next? 
[Publishing](https://github.com/timemate/homebrew-tap) a golang application to [homebrew](https://brew.sh), so anyone can use it.

## GRPC

In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services. As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. On the server side, the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls. On the client side, the client has a stub (referred to as just a client in some languages) that provides the same methods as the server.

### Protocol Buffers

By default, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, Googleâ€™s mature open source mechanism for serializing structured data (although it can be used with other data formats such as JSON).

Let's have a look into our tracking api interface.

```protobuf
package tracker;

service TrackerApiService {
  rpc GetTimeEntries(GetTimeEntriesRequest) returns (GetTimeEntriesResponse) {}
}

message TimeEntry {
  string id = 1;
  string description = 2;
  string start = 3;
  string end = 4;
  repeated string tags = 5;
  string source = 6;
}

message GetTimeEntriesRequest {
  string start = 1;
  string end = 2;
}

message GetTimeEntriesResponse {
  repeated TimeEntry entries = 1;
}
```

**Updating the Protocol**
If you update the protocol buffers file, you can regenerate the file using the following command.

```shell
protoc \
  --go_out=. \
  --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
  --go-grpc_out=. \
  --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
  ./proto/tracker.proto
```

## Plugins in Golang

### Compile-time plugins
Compile-time plugins consist of code packages that get compiled into the application's main binary. Once the binary is built, its functionality is fixed.

The best known example of a compile-time plugin system in Go is drivers for the `database/sql` package.
Usually Discovery and Registration of such plugins happens automatically, when you `import` a package.

### Run-time plugins
Run-time plugins consist of code that does not get compiled into the original binary of the main application; instead, it hooks up to this application at run-time. In compiled languages, a common tool to achieve this goal is *shared libraries*(.so), and Go supports this approach as well.

Go comes with a plugin package built into the standard library. This package lets us write Go programs that get compiled into shared libraries instead of into executable binaries; further, it provides simple functions for loading shared libraries and getting symbols from them.

Discovery and Registration: accomplished via file system lookup.

File `./lang/eng.so`
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type greeting string

func (g greeting) Greet() {
    fmt.Println("Hello Universe")
}

// exported as symbol named "Greeter"
var Greeter greeting
```

Building the plugin:
```shell
go build -buildmode=plugin -o eng/eng.so eng/greeter.go
```

And usage of the plugin:
```go
package main

import "plugin";

type Greeter interface {
	Greet()
}

func main() {
	// determine plugin to load
	mod := "./lang/eng.so"

	// load module
	// 1. open the so file to load the symbols
	plug, err := plugin.Open(mod)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// 2. look up a symbol (an exported function or variable)
	// in this case, variable Greeter
	symGreeter, err := plug.Lookup("Greeter")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// 3. Assert that loaded symbol is of a desired type
	// in this case interface type Greeter (defined above)
	var greeter Greeter
	greeter, ok := symGreeter.(Greeter)
	if !ok {
		fmt.Println("unexpected type from module symbol")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// 4. use the module
	greeter.Greet()

}
```

However, this approach also has some serious downsides. The most important downside is that Go is very picky about keeping the main application and the shared libraries it loads compatible.

#### Alternatives?

RPC-based plugin systems!

[hashicorp/go-plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) is one of the most popular.

It has several important upsides:

- Isolation: crash in a plugin does not bring the whole application down.
- Interoperability between languages: if RPC is the interface, do you care what language the plugin is written in?
- Distribution: if plugins interface via the network, we can easily distribute them to run on different machines for gains in performance, reliability, and so on.

Let's take a look into a [code example](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin/tree/master/examples/grpc)

# Next Steps

- Build first gRPC server/client
- Let's implement a couple of services on each side to see the whole picture
- Prepare TimeMate app for publication to [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
